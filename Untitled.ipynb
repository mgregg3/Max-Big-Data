    "In conclusion, Movies that fail the Bechdel test make more money on average than movies that pass the test.  Although this is true, there are other factors that I did not test for that could be the reason for this inequity that have nothing to do with the characters gender.  One major factor is there are more major movies that fail the test than pass the test.  The major movies are the movies that make the most revenue in the movie business.  Because more movies fail than pass in the major grossing movies, those movies make larger margins of profit since they are bigger names.  This could be a confounding correlation in that the movies that fail could possibly make more because there are more of them or because they fail.  I cannot prove one or the other based on the work I have done but I think the fact that most of the most successful movies fail the test this is more of a cause for the inequity than passing or failing the Bechdel test.\n",
