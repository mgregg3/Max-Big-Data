    "Reflection:  When I started this project, my intentions were to figure out what basic factors make a large difference in Startup compnaies success or failure.  I foud a dataset online that gave information about where a company was started, whether it was started in the summer or winter, what year it was started, and whether it is still running, got bought, or dead.  This is something I am interested in because business in general intrests me and it is cool to put this in a larger light.  There are so many things that we consider common knowledge involving business.  So many things that we assume good business tactics.  For instance, people think it is smarter to start a company in califonia because there is a lot of innovation and other startups that have been successful there.  So I investigated using K-nearest Neighbors to find if there is any correlation between the features.  Essentially if I got a high accuracy that would mean that the startups statistics would be varied based on success and successful companies would have similar traits and failed companies would have similar traits.  My accuracy was around 50% for my K-NN test.  This tells me that the features that are in my dataset are not significant enough for the computer to decifer between successful and failure companies.  Basically if two companies started in new york, in the same season, in the same year, they may have completely different values of success.  This was slightly dissapointing because this means I could not find which of these features are important for startup companies to succeed. But, by telling me what I didn't know, it also tells me what I do know.  What I do now know is that there are other factors that are much more important for the success of a startup company then where its from or what season/year it was started in. If I did some more reasurch and was maybe able to integerize some statistics like bussiness connections, and who and when and how much funding came in, I would be able to tell more about factors of startup success.  But in this lab, all I can say is a startup's success is not based on where and when it starts even though it is known as a common business tactic to strategically start your company based on these factors."
